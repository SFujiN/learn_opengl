# learn_opengl
My run through of Learn OpenGL exercises, mainly to keep me motivated and documentation.

## Instructions
There are a bunch of interesting exercises, but the current most interesting one is camera_ex2, which just allows you to walk around a scene with boxes.
Take a look at the `makefile` to make the other exercises if interested.
```
cd src
make camera_ex2 && ./camera_ex2
```

## TODO
- expand on the exercises as a whole
- make write ups on how each one works for review
- add pictures`
